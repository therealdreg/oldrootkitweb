# motivation

One of my great passions is electronics and embedded system programming

I really enjoy programming [AVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers){:target="_blank"} and [ARM Cortex-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M){:target="_blank"}

Due to the big learning curve for a hardware-noob-level I have decided to create [rootkit.es](https://www.rootkit.es)

A place for learning electronics and making hardware+firmware+software prototypes for hackers and education
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

All with  [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License){:target="_blank"} when it is possible
