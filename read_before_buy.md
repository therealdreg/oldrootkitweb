# read before buy
{:read before buy}

- [rootkit.es](https://www.rootkit.es) is a project by enthusiasts for enthusiasts
- I do not and will not do dropshipping
- I make a lot of work from my house:
  - QA
  - packaging
  - hand soldering 
  - visual inspection
  - test all the functionality of each board:
    - I use raspberry pi to test USB-board-devices: HID, MASS STORAGE etc
    - I use arduino and own pcbs to test accessible pins etc
    - I made some manual tests like connect USB-board-devices to a PC and verify if all works as expected
  - program the microcontrollers
  - test some firmwares in each microcontroller
  - check if JTAG debugging/programming works
  - a lot of manual work. 
  - I prefer to give a good quality rather than sell a lot

for these reasons the stock is limited and the price is higher than others

**due manual work, please be patient and note that errors may exist**
